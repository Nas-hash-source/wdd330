                <p>The localStorage object enables me to store data locally. 
                    Its method getItem(key) retrieves the value of the key, however 
                the method setItem(key, value) stores the value based on the key. </p>

                <p>Predicting the users' behavior helps me give them better experience 
                    , conditionals play a crucial role in that case. In the even or odd exercise, 
                    the output varies depending on the user's input by using if, else if and else.

                <p>An array regroups things and store different types of variables instead of declaring them one by one. 
                    We create one by enclosing them with brackets and seperating them with a comma []. 
                    For example, const list = [12, "text", 40]. Loops are used for iteration and an example of that is for/of 
                    which give us access to each item in the array.
